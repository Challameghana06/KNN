# ü§ù K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation in Python

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification and regression tasks using Python.  
It includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation metrics, and visualization of results to understand how KNN works in different scenarios.

## üìò Contents
- Introduction to KNN Algorithm  
- Data Loading and Preprocessing  
- Feature Scaling (Standardization/Normalization)  
- Training the KNN Model  
- Hyperparameter Tuning (Choosing Optimal K)  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)  
- Visualization of Decision Boundaries  
- Comparison with Other Classifiers (if included)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Install the following Python libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Technologies Used :
>Python 3.x
>Jupyter Notebook
>NumPy & Pandas ‚Äî for data handling
>Matplotlib & Seaborn ‚Äî for data visualization
>Scikit-learn ‚Äî for model implementation and metrics

Visualizations :
The notebook includes:
>Scatter plots for data distribution
>Accuracy vs. K-value line chart
>Confusion matrix heatmap
>Decision boundary visualizations

Key Concepts
Distance Metrics	:Uses Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski distance to compute nearest neighbors
K Parameter:	Number of nearest neighbors considered for prediction
Feature Scaling:	Ensures distance-based algorithms perform accurately
Majority Voting	Classification is based on the majority label among neighbors
